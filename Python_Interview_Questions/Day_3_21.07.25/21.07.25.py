#Ques-1
# what are the different data types in python?
# text-string
#number-int,float,complex number
#sequence-list,tuple,range
#set-set,frozenset
#mapping-dict
#binary-byte,bytearray,memoryview
#None-none

#Ques-2
# How do you iterate through a list in python?
#Answer: x = [1,2,3]
#        for i in x:
#           print(i)
# by list comprehnsion
#         print([i: i for i in x])

#Ques-3
# what is dictionary and how do you access its elements
#Answer dictionary is the mapping type of data type which can store the item in key value pair
#example  stationery = {'Pencil':2,'Rubber':3}
#access the element
# print(stationery[pencil])
# output would be 2
# if we want to get the key of the dictionary
#print(stationery.keys()
#output = Pencil,Rubber

#Ques-4
#Explain the concept of conditional statement in python?
#Ans: when we have condition and we want the response accordingly
# like if,else,elif condition to satisfy those condition and response on that basis
#Example if the person is greater than 18 than he/she can vote else they dont
# if age >= 18:
#   print("he is allowed to vote)
# else:
#   print("he is not allowed to vote)

#Ques-5 what are the function and how do you define them
#Ans-function are the block of code which we can write once but we can reuse the same whenever needed.
# like def sum(a,b):
#       sum = a + b
#       return sum
# a = 2,b = 3
# print(sum(a,b))

#Ques-6 How do you handle error and exception in python
#Answer: we can write the code in the try and except block where in try block we can write the whole code which wants to execute and
# in except we can raise the error if something does not execute

# Ques-7 what does the garbage collector do
#Answer: garbage collection automatically allocate and deallocate the memory in python

# Ques-8 how do you import external libraries in python
# Answer by using import method
# import math
# import random

# Ques-9 Explain the difference between mutuable and immutuable object in python?
#Mutuable object are those on that we can perform the CRUD operation like create,read,update and delete
# ex- list,dict
# immutable object are those on that we can do read operation and not able to perform CRUD operation
# ex-set,tuple
#Ques-10- what is the 'in' operator in python?
#Answer-in operator basically check the element exist in the data set or not
# example- x = 1,2,3
#          a = 2
#          if a in x:
#            print(f"Yes {a}does exist in {x})

# Ques-11-How we can write the docstring in python
#Answer-we can use triple quoted string to write the functions,explaining their purpose,arguments, and return values
