1 What is python and its key feature
Ans: Python is the high level programming language which commonly use in web-development,data-science,games etc in all the fields
key feature
1.Easy to understand
2.Intrepreted language
3.Dynamic Typic-like we dont need to assign the data type for the variables initially python can understand by their own
4.Extensive Libraried and Frameworks
5.Compatiable with other platforms

2.What are python list and tuples
Ans: Python list work like an array but there we can store hetrogeneous data type.
1. we can perform all the CRUD operation on list
2. it is mutuable type data type
3. we store the elements in a square brackets
4. performance wise it is bit slow
tuple: tuples are immutuable data type where we can view all the stored elements but we cannot perform any CRUD operation there and we use round brackets to store the data.
EX:List
a = [1,2,3,4]
tuple
a = (2,4,5,1)

3. What is __init__ file in python
Ans: The __init__() method is known as constructor in OOP's. it is used for initialized an object's state when it is created.This method is automatically called when the new instance of a class is instantiated.
Purpose: a)Assign values to the object propertied
         b) Perform any initialization operations
Example: We have created a 'stationery' class and added the constructor and notebook function().The constructor will store the book title name and the notebook() function will print the notebook name
class Stationery:
def __init__(self,name):
      self.name = name
def notebook(self):
    print("The name of the book is',self.name)

b = Stationery('Science')
b.notebook()
o/p= The name of a book is 'Science'

4.what are the mutuable and immutable data types
Ans: Mutuable data types are those who perform CRUD operation on their elements like list,dict however immutuable data type does not perform any crud operation
like tuple,string

5.Explain list,dict and tuple comprehnsion with an example
list comprehnshion: is the expression which we can write in a one line and perform the overall operation on the list element
syntax: [expression based on the loop and if condition]
example : even number up to 20 we have list comprehnsion is [i for i in range(1,20) if i % 2 == 0]

dict comprehnsion:it is same like list comprehnsion we can create a dictionary based on the existing table with a single line of code,we need to use {} braces for writing the syntax
square_dict = {i*i for i in range(1,20)}

Tuple comprehnsion is bit different from tuple like it does not return the tuple it returns generator object and we use () braces to perform the tuple comprehnsion
square_tuple = (i*i for i in range(1,20))

6. what  is GIL(Global Interpreter lock) in python and why it is important
Ans: The GIL is a mutex used in CPython(the standard python interpreter) to prevent multiple native threads from executing python bytecode simultaneously.it simplified memory management but limit multi threading performance for cpu bound task
this make threading in python less effective for certain task,though it works well for I/O bound operations
